# Benicio's elite-qualifier chatbot! #
Type to the bot to get a response!
------------------------
# How it works #
The chat bot has a personality that is randomized when starting the program, so far the personality factors are confidance and boredom.
I imagine boredom will determine the flow of the conversation while other personality traits, such as confidance, will effect how the bot responds.
-------------------------
# Goals #
I want to add more features into the bot, these are my goals from most to least important
<ol start="1">
 <li>More responses</li>
 <li>More personality systems</li>
 <li>Dynamicly changing personality based on the flow of the conversation</li>
</ol>
